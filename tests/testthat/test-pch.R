## Plotting characters by name
##
## The value of naming them is that a name can be CHECKED and a number cannot:
## pch = 26 is accepted by graphics and draws nothing, and 16 against 19 is a
## difference no reader can interpret. So these tests care about two things --
## that every name lands on the code base R actually uses, and that a wrong one
## stops rather than drawing something arbitrary.
