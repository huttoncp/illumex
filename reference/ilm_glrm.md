# A low-rank model with a loss chosen per column

The same idea as principal components – describe every row with a
handful of numbers – but with a loss appropriate to each column's type
rather than squared error everywhere. A binary column gets logistic
loss, a categorical one multinomial across its levels, a count Poisson,
and a numeric one squared error, which is where this reduces to ordinary
PCA.

## Usage

``` r
ilm_glrm(
  data,
  cols = NULL,
  rank = 2L,
  loss = NULL,
  lambda = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  maxit = 300L,
  tol = 1e-07,
  seed = 1L,
  progress = NULL,
  time = c("cycles", "elapsed", "drop")
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame.

- cols:

  Columns to use; see
  [ilm_selection](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_selection.md).

- rank:

  Number of dimensions.

- loss:

  Optional named character vector overriding the automatic choice per
  column: `"quadratic"`, `"logistic"`, `"multinomial"` or `"poisson"`.
  An **ordered** factor defaults to `"multinomial"`, which ignores the
  ordering but never invents a spacing; `"quadratic"` on its integer
  codes uses the ordering and does invent one, and is available if that
  is the trade you want.

- lambda:

  Ridge penalty on the factors, or `NULL` (the default) to choose it by
  holding out observed cells. It is not a detail: a row with few
  observed cells has as many scores as observations and fits them
  exactly, so without enough penalty the reconstruction of everything
  else in that row goes wherever the algebra sends it. On a 400 by 4
  matrix with 20% missing, held-out error ran 0.82 at `lambda = 0.1`,
  0.68 at 2, and 1.16 at 25 – against 0.78 for an iterative SVD and 1.18
  for column means. The best value depends on the size, the width and
  the missingness, which is why it is chosen rather than fixed.

- weights:

  Optional non-negative row weights. A row counted twice contributes
  twice to the loss, which is how `illume::ilm_impute()` draws a
  bootstrap replicate without resampling the rows themselves and losing
  the ones it has to reconstruct.

- maxit:

  Maximum alternating passes.

- tol:

  Relative change in the objective at which to stop.

- seed:

  Random seed for the starting point.

- progress:

  Show a progress bar; see
  [ilm_progress_arg](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_progress_arg.md).

- time:

  What to do with date and date-time columns, which are given the
  quadratic loss. `"cycles"`, the default, uses each as the time since
  its earliest value – its order and spacing, in one column – and adds
  the time of day, the day of the week, the day of the month and the
  time of year, each as a sine and cosine so that the ends of the cycle
  meet, but only the cycles some other column varies with, and only
  where the data cover two of the cycle. A cycle nothing else follows is
  noise to a clustering: on two known clusters, every cycle given
  unasked took recovery from 0.38 to 0.10 where the date meant nothing,
  while the tested ones left it at 0.36 there and, where a rhythm was
  real, raised it from 0.36 to between 0.58 (month-end) and 0.94 (winter
  against summer). The test looks at no more than 5,000 rows and takes a
  second or two on wide data. `"elapsed"` is the time since the earliest
  value alone – it cannot see a rhythm, since a number that only grows
  puts every Monday somewhere new – and skips the test, for very large
  data or when only order matters. `"drop"` leaves dates out. A duration
  (`difftime`) is used as its number of days.

## Value

An object of class `"ilm_glrm"` with `scores` (one row per observation),
`archetypes`, the per-column `loss`, the `objective` trace and a
`fitted` data frame reconstructing each column on its own scale.

## When this is worth the iterative fit

On all-numeric data it is not: with quadratic loss everywhere it *is*
PCA, and
[`ilm_reduce()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_reduce.md)
gets there in closed form. It earns its cost when categorical columns
matter, because FAMD reaches them by one-hot encoding and applying
squared loss to the indicators, which is a Gaussian approximation to
something that is not Gaussian, and can reconstruct a category as -0.3.

## Missing values are not a special case

A cell that was not observed contributes nothing to the loss, so the fit
uses whatever is there and the reconstruction fills the rest in. That is
why the same machinery serves `illume::ilm_impute()`.
