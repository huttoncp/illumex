# Scatter plot

Scatter plot

## Usage

``` r
ilm_plot_scatter(
  data,
  y,
  x,
  by = NULL,
  trend = c("none", "lm", "loess"),
  ...,
  pch = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame.

- y, x:

  Names of the numeric columns.

- by:

  Optional grouping column.

- trend:

  `"none"`, `"lm"` or `"loess"`. A trend line here is a description of
  the two columns shown and nothing more – it holds nothing else fixed,
  so it is not the effect `illume::ilm_model()` would estimate.

- ...:

  Passed to
  [`tinyplot::tinyplot()`](https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot/man/tinyplot.html).

- pch:

  Plotting character. Takes a NAME as well as a number:
  `"filled circle"` is 16, and every code from 0 to 25 has one. Case,
  spaces, underscores and hyphens are ignored. A single character is
  drawn literally, so `pch = "x"` is still the letter x.

## Value

`NULL`, invisibly.

## See also

[`ilm_plot_var_pairs()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_plot_var_pairs.md)
for every pair at once.

## Examples

``` r
ilm_plot_scatter(mtcars, "mpg", "wt", by = "cyl", trend = "lm")
#> Warning: 
#> Continuous legends not supported for this plot type. Reverting to discrete legend.
