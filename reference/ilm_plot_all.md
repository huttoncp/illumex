# Small multiples of every variable

Legends are suppressed in this layout: tinyplot reserves legend space by
altering the device layout, which blanks a multi-panel figure. Plot a
single variable with
[`ilm_plot()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_plot.md)
when you need one.

## Usage

``` r
ilm_plot_all(
  data,
  by = NULL,
  class = "all",
  max_panels = 12L,
  n_max = 5000L,
  verdict = FALSE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame.

- by:

  Optional grouping variable, drawn as colour with a legend.

- class:

  `"all"`, or one or more of `"numeric"`, `"categorical"`, `"logical"`,
  `"time"`.

- max_panels:

  Stop after this many variables.

- n_max:

  Above this many points a scatter becomes a binned density.

- verdict:

  Annotate the plot with the diagnostic verdict.

- ...:

  Passed to
  [`tinyplot::tinyplot()`](https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot/man/tinyplot.html).

## Value

Invisibly, a list of the per-panel results.

## Examples

``` r
ilm_plot_all(ilm_sim(), class = "numeric", max_panels = 4)
#> ilm_plot_all: showing the first 4 of 7 variables; raise `max_panels` to see more
```
