# Class-aware description of one variable

Summarises a vector, or one column of a data frame, with statistics
chosen for its class. Numeric variables also get a gaussian agreement
index and, where that is low, a plain-language reason.

## Usage

``` r
ilm_describe(
  data,
  y = NULL,
  by = NULL,
  digits = 3,
  gauss = c("index", "ks_d", "both", "none"),
  probs = c(0, 0.5, 1),
  skew = FALSE,
  kurt = FALSE,
  dispersion = TRUE,
  rare_n = 5L,
  cap = 0.12,
  min_n = 20L
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame, or a vector when `y` is `NULL`.

- y:

  Name of the column to summarise, or several names. With none, `data`
  is taken as the thing to describe: a bare vector, or a data frame
  whose columns are all of one kind. For a frame of mixed kinds use
  [`ilm_describe_all()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_describe_all.md),
  which returns one table per kind.

- by:

  Optional character vector of grouping columns.

- digits:

  Rounding for numeric columns, quantiles included.

- gauss:

  One of `"index"` (the 0-1 agreement index), `"ks_d"` (the raw
  Kolmogorov distance behind it), `"both"`, or `"none"`.

- probs:

  Quantiles to report, as proportions. `c(0, 0.5, 1)` gives `p0`, `p50`
  and `p100`; any vector works and the column names follow it.

- skew, kurt:

  Add moment-based skewness and excess kurtosis.

- dispersion:

  Add the variance-to-mean ratio for non-negative integer variables.
  Meaningful only if you intend to model the variable as a count.

- rare_n:

  Levels with fewer observations than this count as rare.

- cap, min_n:

  Control the `gauss` index; see
  [`ilm_gauss_check()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_gauss_check.md).

## Value

A one-row data frame, or one row per group when `by` is used.

## Details

The default output is deliberately narrow. Quartiles, skewness and
kurtosis are available on request, but `gauss` and `gauss_note` already
say whether they are worth asking for.
