# The bootstrap distribution behind a group difference

Draws the replicate differences from one row of an
[`ilm_boot_diff()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_boot_diff.md)
result, with zero and the interval marked. The summary says where the
difference is; this says what the resampling actually produced – whether
it is symmetric, skewed, or piled against a boundary, which the interval
alone cannot show.

## Usage

``` r
ilm_plot_boot_diff(
  x,
  row = 1L,
  type = c("density", "histogram"),
  ref_line = 0,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An
  [`ilm_boot_diff()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_boot_diff.md)
  result.

- row:

  Which comparison to draw, when the result has several. The default
  draws the first, and having more than one is normal now that
  [`ilm_boot_diff()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_boot_diff.md)
  compares every pair.

- type:

  `"density"` or `"histogram"`.

- ref_line:

  Where to draw the reference line.

- ...:

  Passed to
  [`tinyplot::tinyplot()`](https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot/man/tinyplot.html).

## Value

`NULL`, invisibly.

## Examples

``` r
d <- ilm_sim()
b <- ilm_boot_diff(d, "score", "grp", R = 300, seed = 1)
ilm_plot_boot_diff(b, row = 1)
