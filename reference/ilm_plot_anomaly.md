# See an anomaly scan

Four views of an
[`ilm_anomaly()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_anomaly.md)
result. The default, `"scores"`, is the one that decides what to do
next: whether the flagged rows stand apart from the rest, or are only
the top few percent of a smooth continuum that the threshold happened to
cut. A ranked table cannot tell those apart; the shape of the sorted
scores can.

## Usage

``` r
ilm_plot_anomaly(
  x,
  type = c("scores", "drivers", "map", "row"),
  row = NULL,
  top_n = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  main = NULL,
  ...,
  pch = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An
  [`ilm_anomaly()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_anomaly.md)
  result.

- type:

  Which view: `"scores"` (the default), `"drivers"`, `"map"` or `"row"`.

- row:

  For `type = "row"`, the row to show, numbered as in the scanned data –
  the `row` column of the result. Defaults to the highest-scoring row.

- top_n:

  How much to show: ranks for `"scores"` (by default the larger of 40
  and three times the number flagged), columns for `"drivers"` (15) and
  `"row"` (20). Ignored by `"map"`.

- data:

  The data frame that was scanned, for `"map"` and `"row"`. Only needed
  if the result did not keep it – see `keep_data` in
  [`ilm_anomaly()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_anomaly.md).

- main:

  Plot title.

- ...:

  Passed to
  [`tinyplot::tinyplot()`](https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot/man/tinyplot.html).

- pch:

  Plotting character for the points in `"scores"` and `"map"`. Takes a
  name as well as a number: `"filled circle"` is 16, and every code from
  0 to 25 has one.

## Value

`NULL`, invisibly. The verdict is written on the plot, and where it
calls for a remedy it is also given as a message.

## The four views

- `"scores"` – every row's score against its rank, highest first, with a
  line at the number flagged. For the default reconstruction method a
  band shows where 95% of the datasets the scan simulated, which have
  the same structure and no anomalies, put the score at each rank.
  Genuine outliers are a few points well above the band, after which the
  curve drops back into it. A continuum has no break: the rows after the
  line keep scoring above what clean data produce. When that happens the
  plot says so, and the choice is to say plainly that you are reporting
  a fixed share of the rows, or to treat the tail as structure rather
  than as outliers –
  [`ilm_profile()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_profile.md)
  looks for the groups in it.

- `"drivers"` – how many flagged rows each column drives, with a tick at
  the count the drivers of the unflagged rows would predict. When one
  column drives nearly every flag the problem is usually in that column
  – a unit, a sentinel code, a misplaced decimal – rather than in how
  the columns combine. Look at it on its own with
  [`ilm_outliers()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_outliers.md)
  or
  [`ilm_describe()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_describe.md),
  and recode sentinels with
  [`ilm_recode_errors()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_recode_errors.md).

- `"map"` – every scored row on the first two dimensions of
  [`ilm_reduce()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_reduce.md),
  in grey, with the flagged rows in red and sized by score. Flagged rows
  that sit together may be one problem repeated or one subpopulation,
  and `ilm_profile(x)` takes the flagged rows and describes them. A
  reconstruction anomaly is odd *off* the main dimensions, so it need
  not sit at the edge of this map: the view shows whether the flagged
  rows are alike, not whether they are extreme. Needs the PCAmixdata
  package, as
  [`ilm_reduce()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_reduce.md)
  does.

- `"row"` – one row, column by column: its z-score, which is how unusual
  each value is in its own column, beside its residual, which is how far
  the value sits from where the structure shared by the other rows puts
  it. The residual is divided by that column's typical residual (its
  median absolute deviation across rows), so that 3 means unusual on
  both bars; unscaled, a residual of 0.8 is large in a column the
  structure explains well and ordinary in one it barely explains. A
  small \|z\| beside a large residual is a row that is odd only as a
  combination – the case the reconstruction exists for, and the one a
  column-at-a-time scan cannot see. The columns are ordered by that
  scaled residual, so the top bar need not be the `driver` in the table,
  which is the column contributing most to the score.

## Why the band restarts at the line

The band the scan simulates is for data with no anomalies at all. Set
the flagged rows aside and every remaining row moves up by that many
ranks, so against the band as it stands a perfectly clean remainder
scores too high for a long stretch and genuine outliers look like a
continuum. Over 60 scans of 400 rows each, the share of the ranks after
the line sitting above the band as simulated averaged 0.69 with 2%
planted anomalies and 0.65 with 5% – not far short of the 0.82 to 1.00
of noise that genuinely has heavy tails.

So right of the line the band is redrawn for the unflagged rows on their
own: their j-th highest score against the reference at the rank that
matches it in quantile, `j * n / (n - m)` for `m` rows flagged out of
`n`. The band steps up at the line because of this, and the step is the
point: the remainder should begin where a clean dataset's highest scores
do.

## How far to trust the verdict

It is a reading of the band, not a test. Over the first `max(20, 2m)`
ranks after the line it takes the share still scoring above the band:
under a quarter, the flagged rows stand clear; three quarters or more,
there is no break, and the message names the remedy; in between, the
break is not clean and the plot says only that.

Nothing is read off the band when nothing is flagged. The band inherits
the reference's slightly light upper tail –
[`ilm_anomaly()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_anomaly.md)
reports the same thing as the raw p-value running hot – and in data with
no anomalies at all the top twenty scores sat at least half above it in
21 scans of 100.

Measured on fresh scans of 400 rows by 8 columns with a rank-2
structure, 100 per condition, counting the scans that flagged anything:

                                 flagged   stand   no clean     no
                                 anything  clear    break      break
      2% planted anomalies          100      89       11          0
      5% planted anomalies          100      97        3          0
      a single planted anomaly       90      65       17          8
      noise with t tails, 10 df      65      14       19         32
      noise with t tails, 5 df       98       7       26         65
      noise with t tails, 3 df      100      11       31         58

Planted anomalies are almost never called a continuum; heavy tails are
called one in half to two thirds of the scans that flag anything, and
said to stand clear in 7 to 22% of them. Size matters: at 200 rows by 6
columns the t tails were called a continuum in 21 of 53 and 16 of 60
scans, and at 1000 rows by 12 in 58 and 52 of 60, with planted anomalies
called one in at most 4 of 60 at either size. When the verdict and the
picture seem to disagree, trust the picture and look at how far above
the band the points after the line sit.

## Isolation forests

`method = "iforest"` has no null behind its score, so `"scores"` draws
no band and labels the line as what it is: the share of rows you chose
to call anomalous, not a test. `"row"` needs the residuals from a fitted
structure and stops. `"drivers"` and `"map"` work for both methods.
