# Profiling: reduce, cluster, characterise

Three steps that are usually taken together: find the few directions a
set of correlated columns shares, group the rows in that space, and say
what distinguishes each group.

``` r

library(illumex)
```

## The whole thing in one call

``` r

pr <- ilm_profile(d, ndim = 5)
pr
ilm_plot_profile(pr)
```

[`ilm_profile()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_profile.md)
runs
[`ilm_reduce()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_reduce.md),
then
[`ilm_cluster()`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_cluster.md)
on the dimensions it produced, then characterises the clusters. The
three are also available separately, which is what you want as soon as
you disagree with one of its choices.

## Reducing

``` r

rr <- ilm_reduce(d, ndim = 5)
rr
ilm_plot_reduce(rr)
ilm_plot_reduce_scree(rr)
ilm_plot_reduce_contrib(rr)
```

The method follows the column types without being told: PCA for
all-numeric data, multiple correspondence analysis for all-categorical,
and factor analysis of mixed data when both are present. All three are
the same decomposition with different scaling, which is why one function
covers them.

The number of dimensions available is `min(n - 1, p)` for PCA and the
mixed case, and the number of levels less the number of variables for
MCA. Asking for more than exist is an error rather than a smaller
answer, which is worth knowing because an earlier version computed that
ceiling as `p - 1` and failed outright on any two-column selection.

### A different loss per column

FAMD reaches mixed data by one-hot encoding the categories, scaling the
indicators and running PCA on the result. That is fast, has a closed
form, and treats a category as though it were Gaussian – a
reconstruction can come back at `-0.3`, which is not a category.

``` r

rr <- ilm_reduce(d, ndim = 5, method = "glrm")
```

A generalized low rank model keeps the low-rank structure and changes
the loss: quadratic for a numeric column, logistic for a binary one,
multinomial across the levels of a categorical one, Poisson for a count.
Each column is then reconstructed on its own scale, and a category comes
back as a category.

It costs an iterative fit where FAMD has a decomposition, so it is an
option rather than the default. On all-numeric data the two are the
*same model* – with quadratic loss everywhere and no penalty a GLRM is
principal components, verified against the SVD to 1e-16 – so there is
nothing to gain there. What it adds is mixed data, and
`illume::ilm_impute(method = "glrm")` uses the same machinery to impute
categorical columns.

See
[`?ilm_glrm`](https://huttoncp.github.io/illumex/reference/ilm_glrm.md)
for the ridge penalty, which is chosen by cross-validation because a
fixed value is wrong across sizes and missingness rates.

## Clustering

``` r

cl <- ilm_cluster(rr, k_max = 10)
cl
ilm_plot_cluster(cl)
ilm_plot_cluster_gap(cl)
```

`k` is chosen by the gap statistic rather than by eye. The result also
reports what a cluster solution usually hides: how stable each cluster
is under resampling (bootstrap Jaccard), how many rows sit ambiguously
between two of them (silhouette width), and whether any cluster is too
small to be a finding.

A cluster that appears in 45% of bootstrap resamples is not a group, and
the output says so rather than leaving the reader to assume that
everything printed is solid.

## Characterising

The step people usually do by hand, badly. Each cluster is compared with
all rows on every variable the clustering used, and described in that
variable’s own units: a number by its middle half against everyone’s, a
category by the value whose share in the cluster sits furthest from its
share among all rows, a date by its middle half and by any stretch of
the week, month or year where the cluster stands out.

``` r

cat(pr$summary, sep = "\n\n")   # a paragraph per cluster
pr$characterization               # every comparison behind them
pr$frequencies                    # every value of every category, per cluster
pr$by_cluster                     # ilm_describe_all(), by cluster
```

The variables are ranked by a v-test – how far the cluster’s mean or
share sits from everyone’s, in standard errors of a subset that size –
and named, strongest first, when it clears 1.96 and the difference is
big enough to matter: 0.2 standard deviations for a number, 10
percentage points for a share. With many rows a chance difference clears
1.96 on its own, which is what the second bar is for. Variables that set
no cluster apart are said to, after the paragraphs.

That is what a cluster is for: “older, mostly retired, living alone or
in twos” is a finding, and “cluster 3” is not. The v-test ranks the
differences; it does not test them, since the clusters were found from
these same variables.

## What this is, and is not

This is a lighter-weight reimplementation of the `FactoMineR::HCPC()`
plus `catdes()` workflow, with the stability reporting that pipeline
does not do, and without the dependency. It is exploratory. The groups
it finds are descriptions of the sample rather than populations, and
treating a cluster label as a variable in a subsequent model – then
testing whether the clusters differ on the variables that defined them –
is circular.

If the question is whether a *known* grouping differs, that is a model,
and `illume`’s:

``` r

illume::ilm_model(y ~ group, data = d, family = "gaussian")
```

## Structure in the missingness

The same three steps run on the missingness pattern rather than the
values.

``` r

ilm_reduce_na(d)
ilm_profile_na(d)
ilm_plot_profile_na(pr_na)
```

A questionnaire where income and savings go missing together, and
separately from the health block, has structure in its non-response.
Knowing that before choosing an imputation strategy is worth more than
most of what the imputation then does.
