## man/figures/logo.png from the sticker artwork in this folder.
##
## The artwork is a hex on a black square. Everything outside the hex's
## light border ring is made transparent, so the sticker sits cleanly on
## GitHub's light and dark themes and on the pkgdown site, then it is
## cropped to the hex and scaled for the README and the pkgdown home page.
## The same method as illume's dev/logo/make_logo.R, with one addition: this
## artwork carries a small four-pointed watermark in its bottom-right corner,
## outside the hex, which is blacked out first -- left in, it would stretch
## the sticker's extent along its rows and leave a black patch opaque.
##
## The ring's outer edge is anti-aliased against the black, so its outermost
## pixels are part ring, part black. Kept opaque they leave a dark fringe on
## a white page; dropped, the edge is jagged. They are "un-matted" instead:
## a pixel that is fraction a of the ring colour and 1 - a of black gets
## alpha a and the ring colour.
##
## Run from the package root:  Rscript dev/logo/make_logo.R
## then:                       Rscript dev/logo/make_favicons.R
## Needs png and magick; neither is a dependency of the package.
