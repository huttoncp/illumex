## Multivariate anomaly detection from low-rank reconstruction error.
##
## ilm_outliers() asks whether a value is extreme for its own column. This asks
## a different question: whether a ROW is a plausible combination. Someone 150
## cm tall is unremarkable, someone weighing 110 kg is unremarkable, and
## someone who is both is not. Nothing in either column's distribution says so.
##
## The method: most of the variation in a set of correlated columns lies in a
## few directions. Fit those directions, project each row onto them, and
## measure what is left over. A row that respects the correlations is
## reconstructed from k numbers; one that does not is not.
##
## Three things had to be measured rather than assumed, and two of them
## overturned the first design.
##
## THE RANK IS NOT THE IMPUTATION RANK. ilm_impute() chooses it by
## cross-validating held-out cells, which is the right question for filling a
## value in and the wrong one here. On a rank-2 structure in eight columns that
## chose 6 or 7 -- on clean data as well as contaminated -- and the extra
## components spanned the very directions the anomalies departed along.
## Detection fell from 0.975 to 0.560. Parallel analysis chose 2 every time.
##
## THE FIT IS TRIMMED, NOT HELD OUT. The first design scored every row against
## a fit built from other folds of rows, on the reasoning that an anomaly
## inside the fit bends the directions towards itself. The reasoning is sound
## and that remedy did nothing: measured at four contamination levels the two
## agreed to three decimals, because four fifths of the anomalies are still in
## each training fold. Fitting on the rows with the smallest scores and
## iterating does work, because it removes them from the fit rather than a
## fifth of them.
##
## THE REFERENCE IS SIMULATED AND CALIBRATED. The score is not chi-squared: the
## noise scale is estimated, the rank was chosen from the same data, and the
## residual is taken against an estimated subspace. Simulating from the fitted
## structure needs the noise PER COLUMN -- standardising gives every column
## unit variance, so one that loads weakly on the shared directions keeps
## proportionally more of its variance off them -- and needs its level matched
## to the observed median rather than estimated from shrunken in-sample
## residuals. Getting either wrong flagged 38.9% of the rows of data containing
## no anomalies at all.

## Isolation forest: the route for anomalies that live in the CATEGORIES.
##
## WHY IT EXISTS: the reconstruction is a projection, so a category has no
## residual along a direction and the columns are dropped. Against planted
## anomalies that costs nothing on the cases it is built for (AUC 1.000 for an
## extreme value, 0.999 for a jointly-implausible numeric combination) and
## everything on the cases it is not: 0.769 when a category contradicts the
## numbers, 0.505 -- a coin toss -- for a category pairing that never
## otherwise occurs. An isolation forest splits on factors directly, needs no
## embedding and no distance matrix, and scored 0.964 and 0.886 on those two
## while giving up little elsewhere (0.975, 0.950).
##
## `ndim = 1` deliberately. The extended form with oblique splits is better on
## numeric combinations (0.965 against 0.950) and WORSE on rare category
## pairings (0.796 against 0.886) -- and the categories are the reason this is
## here at all.
##
## What it cannot do is the calibrated null. The reconstruction simulates its
## own reference and reports FDR-adjusted p-values; a forest returns a score
## with no null attached, so `p` is NA here and `flag` comes from the
## contamination rate the user is prepared to assume. That is a real
## difference in kind, not a detail, and the print method says so.

#' Rows that do not fit the pattern the other rows make
#'
#' Finds observations that are implausible as a **combination** of values, even
#' when no single value is extreme. [ilm_outliers()] asks whether a number is
#' far out in its own column; this asks whether a row is far from the structure
#' the columns share.
#'
#' A set of correlated columns puts most of its variation in a few directions.
#' Those directions are estimated, each row is projected onto them, and the
#' score is what is left over.
#'
#' @section How many directions:
#'
#' By parallel analysis, and deliberately not by the cross-validation
#' `illume::ilm_impute()` uses on the same decomposition, because the two answer
#' different questions. Imputation wants the rank that best predicts a missing
#' cell. This wants the number of directions that are real shared structure, so
#' that what is left over is residual rather than signal it failed to fit.
#'
#' The difference is large. On a rank-2 structure in eight columns,
#' cross-validation chose 6 or 7 -- on clean data as well as contaminated --
#' and those extra components span the directions the anomalies depart along.
#' Detection fell from 0.975 to 0.560. Parallel analysis chose 2 every time.
#'
#' @section Why the fit is trimmed:
#'
#' The anomalies sit in the same data the directions are estimated from, so
#' they pull the directions towards themselves and are then reconstructed well.
#' `trim` excludes the worst-fitting rows from the fit and refits, so a row is
#' scored against a structure it did not help define. Every row is still
#' scored, the trimmed ones included.
#'
#' It earns its place only where the anomalies share a direction, which is
#' where they can form a component between them. Detection with `trim = 0`
#' against the default 0.25, over 12 datasets each:
#'
#' ```
#'   anomalies along random directions      along ONE shared direction
#'    2%   0.925  vs  0.917                  2%   0.950  vs  0.942
#'    5%   0.967  vs  0.977                  5%   0.797  vs  0.887
#'   10%   0.970  vs  0.978                 10%   0.587  vs  0.670
#' ```
#'
#' Holding rows out in folds instead, which was the first design here, does not
#' work and is not offered: measured at four contamination levels it matched
#' in-sample scoring to three decimals, because most of the anomalies remain in
#' every training fold.
#'
#' @section What it cannot do:
#'
#' When a large share of rows depart along the **same** direction they are not
#' anomalies, they are a subpopulation, and a rank-k fit of the whole data
#' legitimately includes their direction. Detection degrades accordingly: with
#' anomalies sharing one direction, 0.89 of them were found at 5%
#' contamination, 0.67 at 10% and 0.41 at 20%. That is the method reaching its
#' limit rather than failing quietly, and [ilm_cluster()] is the tool for a
#' second group, since finding one is what it is for.
#'
#' @section What the score is compared with:
#'
#' Not a chi-squared distribution. Datasets with the same structure and no
#' anomalies are simulated and scored the same way. `B` can be modest because
#' each simulated dataset contributes `n` null scores rather than one.
#'
#' Measured on 100 matrices of 400 by 8 with a rank-2 structure and **no
#' anomalies at all**: 11 rows of 40,000 were flagged, a rate of 0.00028, with
#' 95 of the 100 datasets producing none. With anomalies present, the rows that
#' were not planted were flagged at 0.0015 to 0.0030 across every design tried
#' above.
#'
#' `flag` uses `p_adj` and is what those numbers describe. The raw `p` runs a
#' little hot -- about 0.064 of clean rows fall below 0.05 rather than 0.05 of
#' them -- so read it as a ranking rather than as a test.
#'
#' @param data A data frame or matrix.
#' @param cols Columns to use; see [ilm_selection]. Under the default method,
#'   numeric columns only -- the reconstruction is a projection, and a category
#'   has no residual along a direction. Anything else is dropped with a note.
#'   `method = "iforest"` uses every column.
#' @param method `"reconstruction"` (the default) or `"iforest"`. The
#'   reconstruction is unbeaten at what it is for -- against planted anomalies
#'   it scores 1.000 for an extreme value and 0.999 for a jointly-implausible
#'   numeric combination -- and it is the only one here with a calibrated null,
#'   so it reports FDR-adjusted p-values. It is also blind to the categories:
#'   0.771 when a category contradicts the numbers, and 0.505, a coin toss, for
#'   a category pairing that never otherwise occurs. An isolation forest splits
#'   on factors directly and reaches 0.964 and 0.886 on those two, giving up
#'   little elsewhere (0.975, 0.950) -- but it returns a score with no null
#'   behind it, so `p` and `p_adj` are `NA` and `alpha` becomes the share of
#'   rows you are calling anomalous rather than an error rate being controlled.
#'   Needs the isotree package.
#' @param ntrees Trees in the isolation forest. Ignored by the default method.
#' @param rank Number of directions; `NULL` uses parallel analysis.
#' @param trim Share of the worst-fitting rows held out of the fit. `0` fits
#'   every row, which lets the anomalies define the structure they are scored
#'   against.
#' @param B Simulated null datasets for the reference. A Benjamini-Hochberg
#'   adjusted p-value cannot fall much below `1 / B`, so a single anomaly among
#'   many rows needs `B` comfortably above `1 / alpha`.
#' @param alpha Flagging level, after a Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment across
#'   rows -- one row in twenty at 0.05 would be 50 rows in a thousand, which is
#'   a list nobody reads.
#' @param seed Random seed.
#' @param keep_data Keep the scanned data on the result, so that
#'   [ilm_anomalous()], [ilm_profile()], [ilm_cluster()] and the describe
#'   functions can take the object directly. Set `FALSE` if the frame is
#'   large and you only want the scores.
#' @param progress Show a progress bar; see [ilm_progress_arg].
#' @return A data frame with one row per observation: `row`, `score`, `p`,
#'   `p_adj`, `flag`, and `driver`, the column contributing most to the score.
#'   The rank and the residual matrix are attributes.
#' @seealso [ilm_outliers()] for the one-column-at-a-time question,
#'   [ilm_cluster()] when the unusual rows turn out to be a group,
#'   `illume::ilm_impute()` which fits the same decomposition to fill values in.
