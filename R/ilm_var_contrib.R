## Which variables are carrying the clustering, and which are only adding
## distance.
##
## WHY THIS EXISTS: neither FAMD nor any distance in this package does variable
## selection, and an irrelevant variable is not neutral -- it contributes its
## full share of the geometry and none of the structure. Measured on data with
## three known clusters and two informative numeric columns, adding two PURE
## NOISE factors took recovery from 0.301 to 0.006. That is not degradation, it
## is annihilation, and it is the largest single effect measured anywhere in
## this comparison: larger than the choice between FAMD and Gower, larger than
## k-means against PAM, larger than the choice of k.
##
## A mixture model that selects variables (VarSelLCM) survives that case --
## 0.397 where FAMD scored 0.006 -- but it assumes the variables are
## independent within a cluster, and when that fails it collapses the other
## way: at a within-cluster correlation of 0.75 it scored 0.047 against FAMD's
## 0.265. So swapping the estimator trades one failure for another.
##
## Measuring the variables instead does not. This reports what each one
## contributes to the separation that was found, so a variable that is only
## adding distance can be seen and dropped -- which is the package's usual
## bargain: name the problem and name a remedy that exists here.

#' What each variable contributes to a clustering
#'
#' Reports, for every variable, how strongly it separates the clusters that
#' were found. A variable near the bottom is contributing distance without
#' contributing structure, and dropping it usually improves the result rather
#' than losing information.
#'
#' @details
#' The statistic is the **between-cluster share of variance** -- eta squared
#' for a numeric variable, Cramer's V for a categorical one -- so both are on
#' a 0 to 1 scale and directly comparable. A permutation reference is computed
#' by shuffling the cluster labels, which preserves each variable's own
#' distribution and destroys only its relationship with the clustering, and the
#' variable is called uninformative when it does not beat that.
#'
#' Neither FAMD nor any distance used here selects variables, and an
#' uninformative one is not harmless: on three known clusters with two
#' informative columns, adding two pure-noise factors took recovery from 0.301
#' to 0.006. Checking is cheap and the remedy is `cols`.
#'
#' @section What this cannot tell you:
#'
#' The clustering was fitted to these variables, so a variable the clustering
#' **used** will separate the clusters it helped make, whether or not it means
#' anything. On three real clusters plus one pure-noise numeric column, the
#' noise column scored 0.441 against the informative columns' 0.576 and 0.550
#' -- visibly weaker, and still "better than chance", because k-means had split
#' on it.
#'
#' So this ranks contribution; it does not prove relevance. Two readings are
#' safe and are what it is for: a variable the clustering **ignored** (no
#' better than a shuffled label) is adding distance and nothing else, and a
#' variable that separates the clusters almost perfectly while nothing else
#' does has not explained the clustering -- it *is* the clustering, and the
#' partition is its levels under another name. That second case is reported
#' separately because from inside a clustering it looks like the best possible
#' result.
#'
#' Settling relevance properly means refitting without each variable and
#' seeing whether the partition survives, which costs one clustering per
#' variable and is not done here.
