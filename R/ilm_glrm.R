## Generalized low rank models.
##
## PCA, and everything built on it, minimises squared error. On a numeric
## column that is the right thing. On a binary one it is not: squared loss on
## a 0/1 indicator says the distance from 0 to 1 is the same kind of quantity
## as the distance from 1.4 to 2.4, and a reconstruction can land at -0.3 or
## 1.7, which is not a category.
##
## FAMD -- what ilm_reduce() does by default -- handles mixed data by one-hot
## encoding the categories, scaling the indicators and running PCA on the
## result. It is fast, it has a closed form, and its treatment of a category is
## a Gaussian approximation to something that is not Gaussian.
##
## A generalized low rank model keeps the low-rank structure and changes the
## loss, one per column:
##
##     minimise  sum_j  L_j( (X Y)_j + mu_j ,  A_j )  +  lambda ( |X|^2 + |Y|^2 )
##
## with L quadratic for a numeric column, logistic for a binary one,
## multinomial across the levels of a categorical one, and Poisson for a count.
## Each column is then reconstructed on its own scale: a category comes back as
## a category.
##
## It costs an iterative fit where FAMD has a decomposition, and it is an
## OPTION here rather than the default for that reason -- on all-numeric data
## with quadratic loss the two are the same model, and the test suite checks
## that they agree with the SVD to 1e-8.

#' A low-rank model with a loss chosen per column
#'
#' The same idea as principal components -- describe every row with a handful
#' of numbers -- but with a loss appropriate to each column's type rather than
#' squared error everywhere. A binary column gets logistic loss, a categorical
#' one multinomial across its levels, a count Poisson, and a numeric one
#' squared error, which is where this reduces to ordinary PCA.
#'
#' @section When this is worth the iterative fit:
#'
#' On all-numeric data it is not: with quadratic loss everywhere it *is* PCA,
#' and [ilm_reduce()] gets there in closed form. It earns its cost when
#' categorical columns matter, because FAMD reaches them by one-hot encoding
#' and applying squared loss to the indicators, which is a Gaussian
#' approximation to something that is not Gaussian, and can reconstruct a
#' category as -0.3.
#'
#' @section Missing values are not a special case:
#'
#' A cell that was not observed contributes nothing to the loss, so the fit
#' uses whatever is there and the reconstruction fills the rest in. That is why
#' the same machinery serves `illume::ilm_impute()`.
#'
#' @param data A data frame.
#' @param cols Columns to use; see [ilm_selection].
#' @param rank Number of dimensions.
#' @param loss Optional named character vector overriding the automatic choice
#'   per column: `"quadratic"`, `"logistic"`, `"multinomial"` or `"poisson"`.
#'   An **ordered** factor defaults to `"multinomial"`, which ignores the
#'   ordering but never invents a spacing; `"quadratic"` on its integer codes
#'   uses the ordering and does invent one, and is available if that is the
#'   trade you want.
#' @param lambda Ridge penalty on the factors, or `NULL` (the default) to
#'   choose it by holding out observed cells. It is not a detail: a row with
#'   few observed cells has as many scores as observations and fits them
#'   exactly, so without enough penalty the reconstruction of everything else
#'   in that row goes wherever the algebra sends it. On a 400 by 4 matrix with
#'   20% missing, held-out error ran 0.82 at `lambda = 0.1`, 0.68 at 2, and
#'   1.16 at 25 -- against 0.78 for an iterative SVD and 1.18 for column means.
#'   The best value depends on the size, the width and the missingness, which
#'   is why it is chosen rather than fixed.
#' @param weights Optional non-negative row weights. A row counted twice
#'   contributes twice to the loss, which is how `illume::ilm_impute()` draws a
#'   bootstrap replicate without resampling the rows themselves and losing
#'   the ones it has to reconstruct.
#' @param maxit Maximum alternating passes.
#' @param tol Relative change in the objective at which to stop.
#' @param seed Random seed for the starting point.
#' @param progress Show a progress bar; see [ilm_progress_arg].
#' @param time What to do with date and date-time columns, which are given
#'   the quadratic loss. `"cycles"`, the
#'   default, uses each as the time since its earliest value -- its order and
#'   spacing, in one column -- and adds the time of day, the day of the week,
#'   the day of the month and the time of year, each as a sine and cosine so
#'   that the ends of the cycle meet, but only the cycles some other column
#'   varies with, and only where the data cover two of the cycle. A cycle
#'   nothing else follows is noise to a clustering: on two known clusters,
#'   every cycle given unasked took recovery from 0.38 to 0.10 where the date
#'   meant nothing, while the tested ones left it at 0.36 there and, where a
#'   rhythm was real, raised it from 0.36 to between 0.58 (month-end) and
#'   0.94 (winter against summer). The test looks at no more than 5,000 rows
#'   and takes a second or two on wide data. `"elapsed"` is the time since the
#'   earliest value alone -- it cannot see a rhythm, since a number that only
#'   grows puts every Monday somewhere new -- and skips the test, for very
#'   large data or when only order matters. `"drop"` leaves dates out. A
#'   duration (`difftime`) is used as its number of days.
#' @return An object of class `"ilm_glrm"` with `scores` (one row per
#'   observation), `archetypes`, the per-column `loss`, the `objective` trace
#'   and a `fitted` data frame reconstructing each column on its own scale.
#' @seealso [ilm_reduce()] for the closed-form FAMD route and
#'   [ilm_reduce(method = "glrm")][ilm_reduce] to use this one inside it.
