## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Reduce, cluster, then say what each cluster IS.
##
## A cluster number tells you nothing. What is wanted is "cluster 4 is the
## heavy, thirsty cars", and the route to that runs through the dimensions: find
## which dimensions a cluster sits unusually far along, then name the variables
## that load most heavily on those dimensions.
##
## The unusualness measure is the v-test, the same device FactoMineR's catdes()
## and condes() use: for cluster c on dimension d,
## (mean_c - mean_overall) / (sd_overall / sqrt(n_c)). It is a standardised
## statement of how surprising the cluster's average position would be if
## membership had nothing to do with that dimension. It is NOT a p-value from a
## model fitted to the whole design -- the clusters were found from the same
## coordinates being tested -- so the 1.96 default is a useful cutoff rather
## than a formal test, and is documented as one.
##
## The characterisation logic is shared with the missingness variant. Only the
## labelling differs: high/low for values, "missing: x" for indicators, since a
## present/missing marker has no meaningful high or low.
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## For values: the direction combines the v-test's sign with the variable's own
## correlation sign on that dimension, because a dimension can run either way.

#' Profile a data set: reduce, cluster, and describe the clusters
#'
#' Runs [ilm_reduce()], then [ilm_cluster()] on the dimensions it produces,

#' of. The result is a sentence per cluster rather than a column of numbers.
#'
#' @section How a cluster gets characterised:
#'
#' By a v-test: for cluster `c` and dimension `d`,
#' `(mean_c - mean_overall) / (sd_overall / sqrt(n_c))`. It measures how
#' surprising the cluster's average position on that dimension would be if
#' membership had nothing to do with it.
#'
#' It is **not a p-value**. The clusters were found from the very coordinates
#' being tested, so the usual sampling argument does not apply and the 1.96
#' default is a threshold that behaves sensibly rather than a 5% test. Treat a
#' characterisation as a description of the partition you have, not as evidence
#' that the partition is real -- the stability and silhouette figures in
#' [ilm_cluster()] are what speak to that.
#'
#' For numeric variables the reported direction combines the v-test's sign with
#' the variable's own correlation on that dimension, since a dimension can run
#' either way. Categorical variables are named without a direction.
#'
#' @inheritParams ilm_reduce
#' @param ... Passed to [ilm_cluster()], for instance `k`, `k_max`, `method`,
#'   `B` or `seed`.
#' @param vtest_threshold Smallest `|vtest|` for a dimension to count toward a
#'   cluster's description.
#' @param top_n_vars How many top-loading variables to name per dimension.
#' @param var_contrib Run [ilm_var_contrib()] on the result and report it.
#'   Nothing in this pipeline selects variables, and an irrelevant one is not
#'   neutral: on three known clusters with two informative columns, adding two
#'   pure-noise factors took recovery from 0.301 to 0.006. So the check runs
#'   here rather than waiting to be asked for, and a clustering that turns out
#'   to be one variable's levels under another name raises a warning -- the
#'   cluster descriptions would otherwise be read at face value, and they
