## Choosing columns without non-standard evaluation.
##
## Naming forty of two hundred columns as a character vector is the one place
## the string-based API genuinely hurts. The tidyselect answer to that is
## data masking, which buys the convenience at the cost of an rlang dependency,
## of making the package harder to drive FROM code -- illume's own study scripts
## loop over column names -- and of silent resolution when a bare name also
## exists in the calling environment.
##
## None of that is necessary. A `cols` argument can take a character vector, a
## regular expression, or a predicate function, and all three are ordinary
## values: assignable to a variable, passable through `...`, and printable. The
## expressive part of tidyselect is the SELECTION, not the masking.

#' How columns can be chosen
#'
#' Wherever illumex takes a `cols` or `by` argument, it accepts any of four
#' things. All are ordinary values, so any of them can be held in a variable and
#' passed along -- which a bare-name interface cannot.
#'
#' * `NULL`, meaning every eligible column.
#' * A **character vector** of names: `c("age", "income")`. Every name must
#'   exist, and a typo is an error naming the columns that do exist.
#' * A **regular expression**, as a single string that is not itself a column
#'   name: `"^score_"` takes every column whose name starts with `score_`.
#'   Matching nothing is an error rather than a silent empty selection.
#' * A **predicate function** applied to each column: `is.numeric`, or
#'   `function(v) is.numeric(v) && !anyNA(v)`.
#'
#' The one ambiguity is a single string, which could be a name or a pattern.
#' A name wins: `cols = "score"` selects the column called `score` even if
#' `scores_2024` also exists. Anything that is not a column name is read as a
#' pattern.

#' ilm_outliers_all(d, cols = is.numeric)
