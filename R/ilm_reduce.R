## Dimension reduction over mixed column types.
##
## PCA when every column is numeric, MCA when every column is categorical, and
## a mixed method when both are present -- chosen from the data rather than
## asked for, because the choice is forced by the column types and making the
## user name it only invites getting it wrong.
##
## The mixed case goes through PCAmixdata::PCAmix(), which handles all three
## natively. That was checked against FactoMineR::FAMD() on the same data before
## being relied on: eigenvalues agreed to two decimals and the individual
## coordinates correlated at |r| = 1.0000 on every dimension, while scaling
## equal or better at every size tried, up to 20,000 rows and 120 columns.
## PCAmixdata brings nothing beyond base R's `graphics`, where FactoMineR pulls
## in 119 transitive packages -- which is why it stays in Suggests behind a
## guard rather than becoming a hard dependency.

#' Reduce a data frame's variables to a few dimensions
#'
#' Takes the columns of a data frame and summarises them as a small number of
#' dimensions. Which method that means is decided by the column types: PCA when
#' they are all numeric, multiple correspondence analysis when they are all
#' categorical, and a mixed method when both are present. A date or date-time
#' column is used as the time elapsed since its earliest value, which keeps its
#' order, and by the rhythms in it that the other columns follow; see `time`.
#'
#' The mixed method is Chavent et al.'s, which belongs to the same
#' generalised-PCA family as the FAMD of Pages without being a
#' reimplementation of it. The two were checked against each other directly and
#' agree for this purpose, matching on eigenvalues and on individual
#' coordinates.
#'
#' @param data A data frame.
#' @param cols Columns to use. A character vector of names, a
#'   regular expression, a predicate function such as `is.numeric`, or
#'   `NULL` for all of them -- see [ilm_selection].
#' @param method `"pcamix"` (the default) for PCA, MCA or FAMD depending on
#'   the column types, in closed form. `"glrm"` fits a generalized low rank
#'   model instead, which uses a loss appropriate to each column's type rather
#'   than squared error on one-hot indicators, and reconstructs a category as a
#'   category. It costs an iterative fit, and on all-numeric data the two are
#'   the same model -- see [ilm_glrm()] for when it is worth that.
#' @param time What to do with date and date-time columns. `"cycles"`, the
#'   default, uses each as the time since its earliest value -- its order and
#'   spacing, in one column -- and adds the time of day, the day of the week,
#'   the day of the month and the time of year, each as a sine and cosine so
#'   that the ends of the cycle meet, but only the cycles some other column
#'   varies with, and only where the data cover two of the cycle. A cycle
#'   nothing else follows is noise to a clustering: on two known clusters,
#'   every cycle given unasked took recovery from 0.38 to 0.10 where the date
#'   meant nothing, while the tested ones left it at 0.36 there and, where a
#'   rhythm was real, raised it from 0.36 to between 0.58 (month-end) and
#'   0.94 (winter against summer). The test looks at no more than 5,000 rows
#'   and takes a second or two on wide data. `"elapsed"` is the time since the
#'   earliest value alone -- it cannot see a rhythm, since a number that only
#'   grows puts every Monday somewhere new -- and skips the test, for very
#'   large data or when only order matters. `"drop"` leaves dates out. A
#'   duration (`difftime`) is used as its number of days.
#' @param ... Passed to [ilm_glrm()] when `method = "glrm"`.
#' @param ndim Number of dimensions to keep.
#' @return An object of class `"ilm_reduce"`: `method` (`"pca"`, `"mca"` or
#'   `"famd"`), `eig` (dimension, eigenvalue, percent of variance and its
#'   cumulative total), `ind_coord` (`row_id` and one column per retained
#'   dimension -- this is what [ilm_cluster()] takes), `var_contrib`
#'   (`variable`, `dim`, `sqload`: how strongly each original variable relates
#'   to each dimension, on a 0 to 1 scale, for numeric and categorical
#'   variables alike), `n`, and `fit`, the underlying `PCAmixdata::PCAmix()`
#'   object for anyone who wants to go past this wrapper.
#' @seealso [ilm_cluster()] to group the rows, [ilm_profile()] for the whole
#'   pipeline, [ilm_reduce_na()] for the same thing applied to missingness.

## ---- the same thing, applied to what is missing ----------------------------

## A present/missing marker is a two-level categorical variable, so building a
## frame of those markers and handing it to ilm_reduce() -- which then picks MCA,
## every column being categorical -- reuses the whole pipeline rather than
## duplicating it. Checked on synthetic data with two indicators built to go
## missing together: the resulting dimension recovered them at squared loadings
## of about 0.85 each, while a third, independently missing indicator loaded on
## a separate dimension.

## ---- the generalized low rank route ----------------------------------------
##
## The same SHAPE of answer as the PCAmix one -- scores per row, a contribution

## know nothing about which produced it. What differs is underneath: a loss per
## column type rather than squared error on scaled indicators.
##
## "Variance explained" here is the share of the fitted linear predictor each
## dimension carries. That coincides with the usual quantity when every loss is
## quadratic and generalises it when they are not. It is not an eigenvalue, and
## nothing downstream treats it as one.
